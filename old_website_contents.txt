Total Control in Poultry
Gut Health & Performance 
A healthy gut is essential for optimum digestibility, nutrient absorption, immunity development and disease resistance. Disruption of gut integrity and imbalance of gut microbiota have negative effects on feed conversion, productivity and health of chicken.
​
Antibiotic-free poultry production is a common trend worldwide due to increasing concerns about antibiotic resistance and bans on antibiotic use by governments in many countries. These circumstances have induced a search for alternative strategies to modulate gut development and health in poultry.

Total Mycotoxin Control
It is not a secret that animal feed containing mycotoxins will negatively impact production. Mycotoxins are very likely to be present in your grain products and feed. Most animal systems are affected by a large dose of a single mycotoxin or a combination of many mycotoxins. Accordingly, it can alter normal intestinal functions such as barrier function and nutrient absorption.
​
Is routine analysis of feed ingredients and feed stuffs really necessary for effective mycotoxin control before the formulation of poultry ration? The truth is that most of the time this is not practical and doesn't provide benefits. 
​
Adding a broad-spectrum mycotoxin binder to the diet can reduce the adverse effect of mycotoxins on poultry health.
​
Phora offers comprehensive solutions to control mycotoxin threats in your operations.

Pathogen Control Without Antibiotics 
In poultry production, antibiotics are widely used to control enteric infections. However, extensive use of antibiotics has the possibility to generate;
Antibiotic resistant pathogens in animal production
Delayed and poor treatment results
Poor immune response after vaccinations
Altered GI flora and poor performance results
Antibiotic-free poultry production is a common trend worldwide because the use of antibiotics has been banned by governments in many countries and due to increasing concerns about antibiotic resistance. These circumstances have induced a search for alternative strategies to modulate gut development and health in poultry.
​
Phora offers the most effective solutions for suppressing intestinal pathogens such as E.coli and Salmonella in breeder, layer and broiler operations and ensure reduction of antibiotic use. 

Total Control in Ruminants
Gut Health & Performance 
The functionality and health of the gastrointestinal tract are important factors in determining dairy and livestock performance (growth, milk yield and meat quality).
​
Producers aim to better understand the factors that contribute to gut health and develop strategies to optimize performance to maintain feed efficiency, growth rate and production standards.
Phora offers comprehensive solutions to improve gut health which ensures high performance and better health of animals.

Total Mycotoxin Control
It is not a secret that animal feed containing mycotoxins will negatively impact production. Mycotoxins are very likely to be present in your grain products and feed. Most animal systems are affected by a large dose of a single mycotoxin or a combination of multiple mycotoxins, even in lower doses. Accordingly, it can alter normal intestinal functions such as barrier function and nutrient absorption.

Is routine analysis of feed ingredients and feed stuffs really necessary for effective mycotoxin control before the formulation of ruminant ration? The truth is that most of the time this is not practical and doesn't provide benefits. 

Adding a broad-spectrum mycotoxin control product to the diet can reduce the adverse effect of mycotoxins on Ruminant health.

Pathogen Control Without Antibiotics 
Unlike the rumen, the gut is lined by a single layer of epithelial cells that serve to facilitate digestion and absorption of nutrients and act as a barrier to invading microorganisms, toxins and dietary antigens. Therefore, optimal intestinal barrier function is key to achieving healthy gut function. Tight junction proteins are one of the key components of regulating intestinal permeability. These tight GUT junctions are crucial for the integrity of the epithelial barrier and the separation of these tight junctions leads to the breakdown of the intestinal barrier (i.e. leaky gut), allowing for harmful molecules and compounds to pass through.
​
As antibiotics are being phased out of livestock production, cost-effective, non-antibiotic strategies must be developed to meet the consumer demands for more environmentally friendly animal production, while also supporting the world’s need for more animal protein.
​
Phora offers key solutions to prevent "epithelial cell damage" and suppress pathogeniz bacteria in the gut. Healthy gut ensures optimal overall performance and health of animals.

Control of calf diarrheas 
Diarrhea remains the leading cause of mortality prior to weaning in beef and dairy calves. Controlling diarrheas is one of toughest challenges in raising calves.
​
Antibiotics are widely used to control and treat diarrheas, however antibiotic therapy is one of the major factors leading to disturbances in the intestinal flora and antibiotic resistance. Much attention had recently been focused on so-called translocation of endotoxins and bacteria through the intestinal wall which leads to systemic infection, shock and multiorgan failure. During diarrhea, E.coli numbers are increased by 5-10.000 fold in the small intestine. So, the appropriate diarrhea control methods need to target suppression of E.coli numbers in the GI track.
​
​
Our patented RFC (Refined Functional Carbohydrates) technology is able to control all kinds of calf diarrhea through:
Intestinal Cell Protection
Gr (-) Pathogen Control
without antibiotics.
