# Supervisor & Asset Checklist (Human Tasks)

## 1. Asset Sourcing (High Priority)
The AI cannot generate these real-world assets. You need to place these in `./src/assets/`.
*   [ ] **Trust Logos:** Find high-res PNGs of the **Arm & Hammer Animal Nutrition** logo, partner logos etc.
*   [ ] **Icons:** Download a "Line Art" icon pack (e.g., from Heroicons or Phosphor Icons) for the 3 Pillars (Biosecurity/Gut Health/ROI). Avoid "cartoon" style icons.
*   [ ] **Team/Office Photo:** If available, find a high-quality photo of the Turkish office or the team. This is needed for the Contact page to prove legitimacy.

## 2. Copywriting & Science (The "Accordion" Content)
The AI has been told to create an "Accordion" for technical details. You need to write the text that goes inside.
*   [ ] **Action:** Open the Old Website text.
*   [ ] **Task:** Copy the explanation of "Tight Junctions," "Endotoxins," and "RFCs."
*   [ ] **Edit:** Clean up the grammar. Remove specific trial dates or P-values if you want to keep it vague, but keep the *biological explanation*.
*   [ ] **Goal:** This text must convince a Nutritionist that you understand biology.

## 3. SEO & Meta Data
*   [ ] **Page Titles:** Define the `<title>` tag for each page.
    *   *Home:* "Phora A.Ş. | Advanced Animal Nutrition & RFC Technology Turkey"
    *   *Ruminant:* "Dairy & Beef Gut Health Solutions | Phora Turkey"
*   [ ] **Descriptions:** Write a 160-character description for the homepage focusing on "Arm & Hammer Distributor" and "Antibiotic Reduction."

## 4. Brand Alignment Review (The "Vibe Check")
Once the AI updates the Homepage Hero with the `chicken_fur.jpg` and overlay:
*   [ ] **Check Opacity:** Is the Green (`bg-primary/85`) too dark?
    *   *Test:* You should see the *texture* of the feathers, but you should not immediately recognize "That is a chicken." It should look like an abstract, organic surface.
*   [ ] **Check Readability:** Is the White text on top perfectly readable? If not, increase opacity to 90%.

## 5. Map Graphic (Future Task)
*   [ ] **Concept:** Create or commission a simple monochromatic map showing lines connecting Turkey to the USA (Arm & Hammer) and India.
*   [ ] **Placement:** This will eventually go on the About page to visually prove "Global Reach."
